## Solar Dose  
Welcome to Solar Dose!

We are very pleased to present the first version of Solar Dose!

### About Solar Dose  
Solar Dose informs you about the sun's altitude based on your location and whether Vitamin D production may occur.

### Solar Altitude and Vitamin D Production  
When the sun reaches an altitude of around 45 degrees, your skin begins producing Vitamin D. This essential vitamin is crucial for bone health and immune system support.

### Optimal Sun Exposure  
Factors such as location, altitude, skin type, clouds, and sun exposure time play a role in getting enough Vitamin D. Normally, 10-30 minutes of sunlight a day is sufficient, sometimes up to 45-60 minutes. Longer exposure does not bring any additional benefits but can damage the skin.

### Sunscreen and Vitamin D  
Sunscreen protects the skin from sunburn and skin cancer, but it also blocks Vitamin D production. Depending on your skin type, it is recommended to spend 10-30 minutes without sunscreen to start Vitamin D production.

## Future Updates  
Solar Dose is continuously improved to provide comprehensive recommendations. Factors such as cloud cover and UV index are taken into account when updates are made.

Thank you for choosing Solar Dose. Stay tuned for updates and new features!
